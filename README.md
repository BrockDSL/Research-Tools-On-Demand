Using docker containers run through a Portainer interface, the Digital Scholarship Lab offers a variety of tools for collecting, analyzing, and presenting your data that are not offered anywhere else on campus!

Currently we support:

- Active Twitter harvesting via the TWARC tool

- Temporary Linux environments to run tests in

- Locally hosted temporary Word Press sites

For other ideas and help on your projects come visit us in the Rankin Family Pavilion at Brock University or e-mail us at DSL@Brocku.ca.
